# User Profile: George (Ai joose Factory)

George is the owner of the **Ai joose Factory** and the architect of the **GraphRAG for Agent Zero** project.

## 🎯 Preferences (2026)
- **Performance**: High value on 2026-era state-of-the-art reasoning (e.g., GraphRAG).
- **Control**: Prefers isolated dev stacks (port 8087) to avoid breaking production OpenClaw or Agent Zero instances.
- **Reliability**: Demands "Meticulous" documentation and E2E proof for every release.
- **Privacy**: Strictly protects personal data and Docker volume settings.

## 🛠️ Technical Context
- **Personal Agent**: Uses a custom Agent Zero profile named **"Mac"**.
- **Tech Stack**: OpenClaw, Agent Zero, Ollama (host), Neo4j (dev container).
- **Maintainability**: Requires that Mac can manage this repo long-term without internet-based hallucinations about the project's history.

## 🚫 Constraints
- Never touch his main Agent Zero settings outside the `dev/` volume.
- Always use the `scripts/check.sh` verification chain.
- Respect the "Extension Subclass" architecture to ensure seamless Agent Zero upgrades.
