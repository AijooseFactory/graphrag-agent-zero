# Architecture Decision Record: ADR-001

## Title: Rename EdgeProxy to Gateway

**Status:** Approved  
**Date:** 2026-01-10  
**Author:** Alice Chen  
**Approver:** Alice Chen (Lead Architect at time)

## Context

The component formerly known as "EdgeProxy" handles all incoming API requests and routes them to appropriate backend services. The name "EdgeProxy" has caused confusion with team members who associate it with edge computing or proxy caching.

## Decision

We will rename "EdgeProxy" to "Gateway" to clarify its role as the primary API gateway for our system.

## Consequences

- All documentation must be updated to reference "Gateway" instead of "EdgeProxy"
- Historical records (incidents, changes) may still reference "EdgeProxy" - these should be noted with "(now Gateway)"
- Code repositories will be renamed in a follow-up change (CHG-003)
