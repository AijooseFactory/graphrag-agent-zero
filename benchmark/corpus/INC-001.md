# Incident Report: INC-001

## Title: Gateway Outage - Memory Exhaustion

**Status:** Resolved  
**Severity:** P1 (Critical)  
**Date:** 2026-01-15  
**Duration:** 47 minutes

## Summary

The Gateway (formerly EdgeProxy) experienced memory exhaustion due to unbounded connection pooling, resulting in a complete service outage.

## Timeline

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| 14:23 | Alert triggered: Gateway memory > 90% |
| 14:25 | Gateway became unresponsive |
| 14:27 | Failover attempted, failed |
| 14:30 | On-call engineer paged |
| 14:35 | Root cause identified: connection pool leak |
| 14:52 | Emergency fix deployed (connection limit imposed) |
| 15:10 | Service fully recovered |

## Impact

- **Failed Requests:** 1,247
- **Affected Services:** Gateway, Auth Service (degraded), Routing Service (degraded)
- **User Impact:** Complete external API unavailability for 47 minutes

## Root Cause

Connection pooling was unbounded. Under high load, connections were created but not properly released, causing memory exhaustion.

## Resolution

See CHG-001 for permanent fix (connection pool limits).

## Lessons Learned

1. All connection pools must have explicit limits
2. Memory limits must be enforced at container level
3. Load testing must include connection pool stress tests
